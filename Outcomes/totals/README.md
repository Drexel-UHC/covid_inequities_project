## byRace_bchc.csv

This file contains cumulative rates of confirmed cases, tests, testing positivity, hospitalizations, and deaths by race/ethnicity group for each city where data was available. This dataset contains both crude and age-adjusted data. We age-adjust using the US 2000 standard population, where data was available. The columns include:
