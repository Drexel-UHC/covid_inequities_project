"top" indicates the   first quartile where the 'exposure_value' is higher than 'percentile_75'.               "middle" indicates the   middle two quartiles where the 'exposure_value' is between 'percentile_25'   and 'percentile_75'. "            bottom" indicates the   fourth quartile where the 'exposure_value' is lower than 'percentile_25'.     |
| date_of_access | Date   that the county/city data source was accessed. For example, a value of   04/01/21 indicates that the data presented in this row consists of cumulative   counts from the start of the epidemic to 04/01/21. Note- there are often   reporting lags, so this value may lag by a number of days or weeks depending   on the county/city data source.    
| source         | Data was collected from one of three sources: LHD (Local Health Department's publicly available data), JHU (Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 data repository) or CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Surveillance data).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     
| geo_level| This column incidates whether the data collected was at the county or city level. Note, all city-county consolidates (Baltimore, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, Denver) have been labeled as city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | |
