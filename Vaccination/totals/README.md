## byRace_vacc_bchc.csv

This file contains cumulative vaccination outcomes by race/ethnicity group for each city where data was available. This dataset contains both crude and age-adjusted data, where data was available. We age-adjust using the US 2000 standard population, where data was available. The columns include:
